# FF-003: Database Migration Foundation

## Ticket Information

- **Project**: FinanceForge
- **Issue Type**: Story
- **Priority**: High (IMMEDIATE NEXT)
- **Status**: To Do
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Sprint**: [To be assigned]
- **Epic Link**: Database Infrastructure Setup
- **Components**: Backend, Database
- **Labels**: migration, flyway, database, infrastructure, oracle

## Dependencies

- **Blocks**: FF-004 (User Authentication Schema), FF-005 (Transaction Schema Design)
- **Depends On**: Oracle Database Setup (must be completed first)
- **Related Issues**: 
  - FF-001: Oracle Database Installation
  - FF-002: Database Connection Configuration

## Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** database version control with Flyway migrations  
**So that** FinanceForge schema changes are tracked, reproducible, and can be safely deployed across environments

## Detailed Description

Implement Flyway database migrations to establish version control for the FinanceForge database schema. This foundation is critical for maintaining database consistency across development, testing, and production environments. The implementation will enable automated database deployments and provide rollback capabilities for schema changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Requirements

- [x] **AC-1**: Flyway Maven dependency added to pom.xml with version 9.x or latest stable
- [ ] **AC-2**: Migration directory structure created at `src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- [ ] **AC-3**: Flyway configuration properly set in `application.yml` with Oracle database connection
- [ ] **AC-4**: Initial test migration file created and executes successfully
- [ ] **AC-5**: Maven Flyway plugin configured with necessary goals
- [ ] **AC-6**: Flyway commands work via Maven (`mvn flyway:migrate`, `mvn flyway:info`, `mvn flyway:clean`)

### Validation Requirements

- [ ] **AC-7**: Database contains `flyway_schema_history` table after first migration
- [ ] **AC-8**: Migration status can be queried and displays correctly
- [ ] **AC-9**: Failed migration handling works (dirty state detection)
- [ ] **AC-10**: Multiple environments configuration ready (dev/test/prod)

## Business Rules

### Migration Standards

- Migration files must follow naming convention: `V{version}__{description}.sql`
  - Example: `V001__Create_initial_schema.sql`
- Version numbers must be sequential and unique
- Migrations are immutable once applied to any environment
- All schema changes must go through migration files (no manual DDL)
- Rollback scripts should be considered for destructive changes

### Quality Standards

- All migrations must be reviewed before merge
- Migrations should be idempotent where possible
- Large data migrations should include progress logging
- Migration descriptions must be clear and descriptive

## Technical Implementation Details

### Maven Dependencies

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    <version>11.11.2</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-database-oracle</artifactId>
    <version>11.11.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Configuration Structure

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    enabled: true
    baseline-on-migrate: true
    validate-on-migrate: true
    locations: classpath:db/migration
    schemas: FINANCEFORGE
```

### Initial Migration Example

- File: `V001__Create_flyway_baseline.sql`
- Content: Basic schema setup or baseline marker

## Definition of Done

### Functional Criteria

- [ ] `mvn flyway:migrate` executes without errors
- [ ] `mvn flyway:info` shows correct migration status
- [ ] Database contains `flyway_schema_history` table with proper entries
- [ ] Clean database can be migrated from scratch
- [ ] Configuration supports multiple database environments

### Quality Criteria

- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by senior developer
- [ ] Documentation updated in project README
- [ ] Migration naming convention documented
- [ ] Error handling tested (failed migration scenarios)
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline considered

### Testing Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for migration configuration
- [ ] Integration test with actual database
- [ ] Tested on clean Oracle database instance
- [ ] Verified rollback procedure documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Oracle-specific syntax compatibility
  - **Mitigation**: Test migrations against actual Oracle instance
- **Risk**: Migration conflicts in team environment
  - **Mitigation**: Clear versioning strategy and code review process
- **Risk**: Large migration performance impact
  - **Mitigation**: Migration execution time monitoring

### Business Risks

- **Risk**: Data loss during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Always backup before migration, test on non-prod first
- **Risk**: Deployment delays due to migration issues
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and staging environment validation

## Environment Considerations

- **Development**: Local Oracle XE database
- **Testing**: Shared test Oracle database
- **Production**: Production Oracle database with proper backup procedures

## Documentation Requirements

- Update project README with Flyway setup instructions
- Document migration creation process
- Create troubleshooting guide for common migration issues
- Document rollback procedures

### Development Notes

- Ensure Oracle JDBC driver is compatible with Flyway version
- Consider using Flyway Teams features for advanced Oracle support if needed
- Plan for future migration complexity as schema grows

### Testing Strategy

1. Test initial setup on clean database
2. Test migration with existing data
3. Test migration failure scenarios
4. Validate multi-environment configuration

## Subtasks

- [ ] FF-003a: Configure Maven dependencies
- [ ] FF-003b: Create directory structure and configuration
- [ ] FF-003c: Implement initial test migration
- [ ] FF-003d: Test and validate migration commands
- [ ] FF-003e: Document setup and usage procedures
